# Evaluation
I provide two simple testing scripts.

`zzd_evaluation_res_faster.m` is only for single query but runs fast.

`zzd_evaluation_res_fast.m` contains a comprehensive testing for single query & multi-query but runs slow.

The code is mainly modified from the official baseline code in (http://liangzheng.org/Project/project_reid.html).
