# Person-reID_GAN
This repository contains the code for our paper [Unlabeled Samples Generated by GAN Improve the Person Re-identification Baseline in vitro](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07717).

We are reviewing the necessary codes and updating this repos. Now this repos is incomplete.

### 1.Unsupervised Learning (GAN)
The first stage is to generate fake images by DCGAN.
We used the code provided in https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow and modify some hyper-parameters.

For more reference, you can find our modified training code and generating code in './DCGAN'.

### 2.Semi-supervised Learning 
The second stage is to combine the original data and generated data to train the network.
This repos includes the baseline code and the three different methods in the paper.

| Methods               | Rank@1 | 
| --------              | -----  | 
| Ours* (SQ)            | 80.82% | 
| Ours* (MQ-avg)        | 86.67% |  
| Ours* (MQ-max)        | 86.76% | 
| Ours* (MQ-max+rerank) | 86.67% |
